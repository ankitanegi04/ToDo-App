# ToDo-App
This is a Todo List web app where users can add, edit, delete, and mark tasks as complete. The frontend is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and the backend uses Node.js with a SQLite database to store tasks. It is a basic full-stack project that shows how to manage data using APIs and SQL.
